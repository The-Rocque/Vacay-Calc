# FAQ:

# "Does this give me the exact number of days I can take for my vacation?"
# No. This is an estimate based off your regularly scheduled shifts and does not include any shifts missed for an illness or any extra shifts that get picked up
# "What if I am casual?"
# Casual workers do not accrue vacation and instead get paid in lieu of benefits.
# "How close is the estimate?"
# It depends. There are some weird things that can happen with wage rate increases, carried over vacation bank, etc. We tried to account for this, but individual circumstances can vary greatly. If the "Available Vacation Hours" is exactly the number you need to take off another shift (ex. 22 hours and 2 shifts), there is a chance you will be shy the actual vacation amount to take off 2 shifts.
# "I am going into my X year of continuous service, doesn't that mean I accrue more vacation?"
# This calculator determines the percentage of vacation that you accrue, which does not change until July 1. If you are scheduling for a vacation after July 1, you might accrue vacation at a higher rate after July 1.
